**Introduction.** Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction, which is characterized by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain and disordered defecation.
Patients are subgrouped according to their predominant stool pattern into IBS with diarrhea (diarrhea-predominant IBS), IBS with constipation, IBS with mixed bowel habits or IBS unclassified.
Therapies for IBS are only modestly effective, as the pathophysiology is not completely understood and is believed to be multifactorial.
In the last decades, the altered human gut microbiota has been proposed as one of the possible causes of IBS [1-2].

The objective of our project was the comparative analysis of the gut microbiota composition in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS and healthy individuals.
